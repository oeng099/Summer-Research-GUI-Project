### Project Description:

This project has two objects: plot emotional coordinates that are entered into the GUI onto a two-dimensional model and allow the user to annotate their emotions on a two-dimensional model while viewing a piece of media. 


### How to use:

Currently, only the visualisation function has been implemented. To reach this function, press the 'visualise' button on the home screen.

# Visualisation

On the visualisation screen there are three ways to enter coordiantes to be plotted. The 'Plot WAV File' functionality is currently still being implemented. 

For 'Select CSV File', pressing the button will open up a window for the user to select a CSV file to plot. Next to the 'Select CSV File' button is an information button which outines the format the CSV file is required to have for the GUI to be able to plot the points. Once a CSV file is selected, press the 'Plot' button to the right of the information button to plot the coordiantes on the model.

To plot emotions manually, the user can input values within the allowed range in the textfields next to the 'Valence:' and 'Arousal:' text and then press the plot button next to it.
