#Working Log

#8 December 2021
Set up the EmotionGUI project with JavaFX.Created three scenes using SceneBuilder: HomeScreen, AnnotationScreen and VisualiseScreen. Research into how to implement a model that will be able to display its fractional values when the mouse is moved around on it will need to be done to be able to properly start to fill out the visualise and annotation scenes. 

#9 December 2021
Implemented functionality for buttons on HomeScreen scene and added in the componenets for the VisualiseScreen scene. AnnotationScreen will likely be blank for now ways to potentialluy implement its functionality are looked into first.

#10 December 2021
Initial functionality for select file button implemented. Main menu button functionality in VisualScreen scene implemented.

#13 December 2021
Added in a scatter plot to represent the valence-arosual model. Also added in functionality for the manual plot. Need to look into scatter plot further to stop it from changing scale.

#14 December 2021
Improved Scatter Chart valence-arousal model so that it now does not change its axes when a series is added. The duplicate series error regardining plotting multiple manual points was also resolved. Clear and save buttons were added to visualise screen with clear functionality implemented.
